# Network Support

Sygma supports EVM and Substrate-based networks natively. The currently supported networks can be found in the links below. The linked pages also contain information on supported resource types, contract addresses, and available fee schemas:

- [Testnet Network Support](https://docs.buildwithsygma.com/environments/testnet/#contract-addresses)
- [Mainnet Network Support](https://docs.buildwithsygma.com/environments/mainnet#contract-addresses)

If there is a network that is not yet supported and you would like Sygma to add support, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Qdf6GyNB5J) or fill out [this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1K4-T_yaKSp6F06FGk4wsSgnmy2x).
