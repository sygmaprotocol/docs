# Network Support

Sygma supports EVM and Substrate-based networks natively. The currently supported networks can be found in the links below. The linked pages also contain information on supported resource types, contract addresses, and available fee schemas:

- [Testnet Network Support](https://docs.buildwithsygma.com/environments/testnet/#contract-addresses)
- [Mainnet Network Support](https://docs.buildwithsygma.com/environments/mainnet#contract-addresses)


If there is a network that is not yet supported and you would like Sygma to add support, please contact us at [requests@buildwithsygma.com](mailto:requests@buildwithsygma.com).
