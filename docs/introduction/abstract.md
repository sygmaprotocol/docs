# Abstract

Recent developments in the Web3 space suggest that the future will be multi-chain. \
\
Dozens of new ecosystems and [dApps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp) have emerged to serve different audiences and host a variety of protocols. Our team has observed that current cross-chain and bridging activities are cumbersome for the majority of end users and that most dApps do not support cross-chain operations. We believe that cross-chain communication will be an important building block for the future of Web3.

With Sygma, we have created an interoperability layer to enable seamless communication for decentralized applications across many chains.

Sygma is a multi-chain and multipurpose bridge focused on supporting dApps to build cross-chain use cases and ensuring optimal UX for their users.
