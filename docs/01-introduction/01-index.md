# Welcome to Sygma Docs

> _Sygma, like the Greek letter sigma (Î£), alludes to summation, the adding up of many things._

Sygma is a fully open source ([Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html)) multi-purpose interoperability layer that supports developers in building cross-chain dApps. A key part in this is removing complexity from the equation. Sygma empowers builders to create streamlined experiences by abstracting the complexities of bridging away and enabling smooth, web2-like user experiences.
