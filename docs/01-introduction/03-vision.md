---

Sygma aims to create a low-effort way for developers to add cross-chain functionality, tap into new liquidity sources, and harness the benefits of multiple chains. By offering native communication that spans EVM, Substrate, and beyond, Sygma functions like connective tissue between blockchain ecosystems, resulting in not only better UX but use cases to fuel the next wave of web3 adoption. 

## The Sygma Vision

Sygma is more than what‚Äôs traditionally considered a ‚Äúblockchain bridge.‚Äù It is a general purpose communication protocol for the next generation of decentralized applications.

Built from the foundations of another open source bridging protocol named [ChainBridge](https://chainbridge.chainsafe.io), Sygma aims to be even more modular and flexible. It employs generic message passing (GMP) to increase the number of options at a developer's disposal. It serves as critical connectivity infrastructure in areas where few or zero options exist, and it‚Äôs a community-driven project in the true spirit of public goods. 

More specifically, the vision for Sygma is best understood as five cornerstone aspects, as illustrated below.

### Beyond EVM

We aim to deliver the same smooth, one-click UX available across EVM-based chains to Ethereum, Substrate, Cosmos, and many more. By enabling developers to leverage the advantages of intrachain communication primitives like XCM and IBC, we empower them to utilize native connectivity.

### Public Infrastructure

Sygma is designed to be the backbone of cross-chain applications. In order to become this, we must be:
1. Fully open source, decentralized, and trust-minimized
2. Governed in a contributor-owned and pluralistic manner 

#### Contributor Ownership and Pluralism

Our approach to governance places significant emphasis on contribution scoring. 

By carefully weighing governance power based on different types of contributions, we can foster an environment where all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate. This method mitigates the influence of single entities on the administration of the protocol, ensuring more equitable and inclusive processes. The full Sygma governance roadmap will be published shortly. 

### Cross-chain Builder Community 

Our vision extends beyond merely providing a good DevEx. We aim to create a thriving and sustainable community of contributors that helps cross-chain builders create and share modular components for effortless integration of cross-chain use cases in DeFi, gaming, and more.

### Tailored Security

We recognize the challenges of _one-size-fits-all_ approaches to security. Instead, we strive to provide tailored security solutions that meet the unique demands of each transaction.

Our adaptive security approach empowers developers to make optimal security choices based on their context. By leveraging a multi-layered framework that combines Proof of Authority (PoA), Optimistic Execution, and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs, Sygma offers unparalleled flexibility. The bottom line: you can enjoy customized security without having expertise in the intricacies of each security layer.

### Permissionless

By orienting ourselves toward permissionless interoperability, we enable the automatic and decentralized provisioning of new tokens and networks. This approach empowers innovation in an unrestricted and inclusive manner.

### The Road Ahead

There‚Äôs a flurry of activity in the space right now, and what we‚Äôre witnessing is nothing less than the emergence of an open, connected network of networks ‚Äî a universe of networks. Supported by grassroots infrastructure projects like Sygma, there‚Äôs a growing recognition that cross-chain applications are no longer fan fiction. They‚Äôre becoming a practical reality. And in the future, deploying dApps that work seamlessly across multiple chains won‚Äôt just be a ‚Äònice to have‚Äô but the table stakes. 

**Let‚Äôs build that futureü§ù**
