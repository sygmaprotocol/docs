## Introduction

We believe that in order to be a trustworthy and reliable backbone for cross-chain applications, Sygma has to be governed in a fair, transparent, and pluralist way. We believe that the cross-chain space can only prosper if the respective protocols are governed by a diverse group of contributors with dedicated measures in place that prevent accumulation of governance power.

We are very mindful about the current tendency in the space to allow large financial institutions and liquidity providers to exercise significant control over infrastructure-type protocols. The Governance-as-Capital ideology has proven to lead to suboptimal and biased governance decisions.

Our vision is that Sygma becomes the ‘Builders Bridge’. In order to deliver on that vision, we plan to follow a path of gradual decentralization of the protocol. We plan to decentralize in two steps:

1. Governance by Network Operators (Q3/2023)
The goal of this phase is to enable all parties that operate a relayer for Sygma to participate in protocol governance. Every relaying partner that is onboarded to Sygma will participate in the protocol administration as outlined in [Protocol Administration](#protocol-administration) below.

1. Extend Governance to Contributors 
In this phase, we will extend Sygma governance to other contributors such as builders, community members, and projects that have integrated Sygma and contributed to its usage. Furthermore, we aim to make ‘Becoming a Relayer’ a permissionless process enabling anybody to participate in protocol operation and governance.

We are extremely excited about starting conversations around governance with our community soon. Based on those discussions, we plan to announce our roadmap for decentralizing the protocol governance in Q3/2023. 

### Protocol Administration

Administration of the Sygma protocol is currently handled by a consortium of early contributors from **ChainSafe Systems** & **Phala Network**, and will be extended to other network operators over the coming weeks. The Sygma protocol is currently administered by a set of multi-signature accounts (MultiSigs):

- Administrative MultiSigs - This includes actions such as adding new tokens and application handlers, changing fee structures, or changing access permissions. This also covers a set of super administrative privileges, such as pausing the bridge, that are required in order to be able to reduce the impact of security incidents.

- Liquidity MultiSigs - This includes actions such as adding liquidity or withdrawals.

### Relayer Network Administration

Becoming a relayer in the Sygma network is currently a permissioned process. You can find more information around the current relaying partners as well as how to become a partner in [Becoming A Relayer Partner](../04-ecosystem/03-relayer-partner.md).
