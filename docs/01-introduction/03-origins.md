After years of working on bridging solutions, we have learned a lot of valuable lessons. Sygma is the product of five years of work within the blockchain space and draws on the deep experience and incredible talent our our diverse engineering team. We have added extensive value to most of the worlds top blockchain ecosystems and this broad experience and perspective makes us uniquely positioned to build Sygma as a world class interoperability product.

We chose this name because Sygma will allow developers to interweave blockchain protocols in a way that gives users something greater than the sum of the parts. Sygma takes the notion of bridging one step furtherâ€”from simple point-to-point money transfers, to an extensible, any-to-any communication protocol.
