## Introduction

We believe that in order to be a trustworthy and reliable backbone for cross-chain applications, Sygma has to be governed in a fair, transparent, and pluralist way. We believe that the cross-chain space can only prosper if the respective protocols are governed by a diverse group of contributors with dedicated measures in place that prevent accumulation of governance power.

We are very mindful about the current tendency in the space to allow large financial institutions and liquidity providers to exercise significant control over infrastructure-type protocols. The Governance-as-Capital ideology has proven to lead to suboptimal and biased governance decisions.
