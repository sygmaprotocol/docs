## Introduction

**Sygma SDK** is an open source library (under [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)) for developers to work within the Sygma ecosystem. The SDK consist of methods that enable bridging capabilities between EVM and Substrate-based networks.

**NOTE:** the SDK is under active development. We encourage developers that discover any bugs or are interested in extending SDK functionality to [submit issues](https://github.com/sygmaprotocol/sygma-sdk/issues) to our GitHub.
