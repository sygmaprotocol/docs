### EVM-to-EVM token transfer example

In the following example, we will use the `TESTNET` environment to perform a cross-chain ERC-20 transfer with 5 `ERC20LRTST` tokens. The transfer will be initiated on the EVM-side via the Goerli Ethereum testnet and received on the EVM-side via the Sepolia Ethereum testnet.

This is an example script that demonstrates the functionality of the Sygma SDK and the wider Sygma ecosystem of relayers and bridge and handler contracts. The complete example can be found in this [repo](
https://github.com/sygmaprotocol/sygma-sdk/tree/main/examples/evm-to-evm-fungible-transfer).

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- Yarn (version 3.4.1 or higher)
- A development wallet funded with `ERC20LRTest` tokens from the [Sygma faucet](https://faucet-ui-stage.buildwithsygma.com/)
- The [exported private key](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key) of your development wallet
- [Goerli ETH](https://goerlifaucet.com/) for gas 

:::danger
We make use of the dotenv module to manage exported private keys with environment variables. Please note that accidentally committing a .env file containing private keys to a wallet with real funds, onto GitHub, could result in the complete loss of your funds. **Never expose your private keys.**
:::

### Getting started

1. Clone the repository 

Clone the sygma-sdk repository into a directory of your choice, and then `cd` into the folder:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sygmaprotocol/sygma-sdk.git
cd sygma-sdk/
```

2. Install dependencies
   
Install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Build the SDK

Build the SDK by running the following command:

```bash
yarn sdk:build
```

4. Usage

This example uses the `dotenv` module to manage private keys. To run the example, you will need to configure your environment variable to include your test development account's [exported private key](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key). A `.env.sample` is provided as a template.

**DO NOT COMMIT PRIVATE KEYS WITH REAL FUNDS TO GITHUB. DOING SO COULD RESULT IN COMPLETE LOSS OF YOUR FUNDS.**

Create a `.env` file in the evm-to-evm example folder:

```bash
cd examples/evm-to-evm-fungible-transfer
touch .env
```

Replace between the quotation marks your exported private key:

`PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"`
   
To send an ERC-20 example transfer from EVM to EVM, run:

```bash
cd examples/evm-to-evm-fungible-transfer
yarn run transfer
```

The example will use `ethers` in conjunction with the sygma-sdk to create a transfer from Goerli to Sepolia with the `ERC20LRTST` token. It will be received on Sepolia as the `ERC20LRTST` token.

### Script functionality

This example script performs the following steps:

- Initializes the SDK by importing the required packages and defining the constants for the script.

```ts
import { EVMAssetTransfer, Environment, getTransferStatusData } from "@buildwithsygma/sygma-sdk-core";
import { Wallet, providers } from "ethers";

const SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID = 11155111;
const RESOURCE_ID =
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000300"; // This is the resource ID for the ERC20LRTEST token according to Sygma's testnet environment 
```

- Configures the dotenv module and sets the `privateKey` as a value to be pulled from the `.env` file.

```ts
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config()

const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;

if (!privateKey) {
  throw new Error("Missing environment variable: PRIVATE_KEY");
}
```

- Defines the ERC-20 transfer function.

```ts
export async function erc20Transfer(): Promise<void> {
```
- Set up the provider, wallet, and asset transfer objects using the TESTNET environment.

```ts
  const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider(
    "https://rpc.goerli.eth.gateway.fm/"
  );
 const wallet = new Wallet(
    privateKey as string,
    provider
  );
  const assetTransfer = new EVMAssetTransfer();
  await assetTransfer.init(provider, Environment.TESTNET);
```

- Constructs a `transfer` object that defines the details of the ERC-20 token transfer using the previously declared constants, as well as the amount to be transferred. As we specify the `getAddress` method from the ethers.js `wallet` module for our recipient, the recipient will be the same address but on a different test network.
  
```ts
  const transfer = assetTransfer.createFungibleTransfer(
    await wallet.getAddress(),
    SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID,
    await wallet.getAddress(), // Sending to the same address on a different chain
    RESOURCE_ID,
    "5000000000000000000" // 18 decimal places, so in this case, 5 tokens would be sent
  );
```

- Retrieves the fee required to complete the transfer from the SDK.
- Builds the necessary approval transactions for the transfer and sends them using the Ethereum wallet. The approval transactions are required to authorize the transfer of ERC-20 tokens.

```ts
  const fee = await assetTransfer.getFee(transfer);
  const approvals = await assetTransfer.buildApprovals(transfer, fee);
  for (const approval of approvals) {
    const response = await wallet.sendTransaction(
      approval as providers.TransactionRequest
    );
    console.log("Sent approval with hash: ", response.hash);
  }
```
- Invokes the `getTransferStatusData` and `getStatus` functions by taking the transaction hash as an input to periodically check the status of the cross-chain transaction.

```ts
const getStatus = async (
  txHash: string
): Promise<{ status: string; explorerUrl: string } | void> => {
  try {
    const data = await getTransferStatusData(Environment.TESTNET, txHash);
    return data as { status: string; explorerUrl: string };
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("error:", e);
  }
};

  let dataResponse: undefined | { status: string; explorerUrl: string };

  const id = setInterval(() => {
    getStatus(response.hash)
      .then((data) => {
        if (data) {
          dataResponse = data;
          console.log("Status of the transfer", data.status);
        }
      })
      .catch((e) => {
        console.log("error:", e);
        console.log("Transfer still not indexed, retrying...");
      });

    if (dataResponse && dataResponse.status === "executed") {
      console.log("Transfer executed successfully");
      clearInterval(id);
      process.exit(0);
    }
  }, 5000);
}
```

- Builds the final `transfer` transaction and sends it using the Ethereum wallet.
  
```ts
  const transferTx = await assetTransfer.buildTransferTransaction(
    transfer,
    fee
  );
  const response = await wallet.sendTransaction(
    transferTx as providers.TransactionRequest
  );
  console.log("Sent transfer with hash: ", response.hash);
}
```
