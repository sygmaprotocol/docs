## Introduction

**Sygma SDK** is an OpenSource (under GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0) library for developers to work with Sygma. The SDK consist of methods that enable bridging capabilities between EVM based networks and Substrate based networks.

**NOTE:** the SDK is under active development, as such you may experience inconsistencies until we have a stable release. We encourage you to [submit issues](https://github.com/sygmaprotocol/sygma-sdk/issues) should you discover any bugs.
