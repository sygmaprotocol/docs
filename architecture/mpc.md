# MPC

**Secure multi-party computation (MPC)** represents a powerful next step in digital asset security because it eliminates the risks of a single point of compromise.

MPC was introduced as a solution for the **Two Billionaires Problem** (Bob and Alice; how to decide who is richer without showing their exact funds, a specific problem which is a Boolean predicate).

The multi-party computation (MPC) model that Sygma employs includes a number of trusted [relayer](relayers.md) nodes. These trusted [relayer](relayers.md) nodes will be run by reputable entities in the web3 space.\


For more on how MPC is used by Syma, see [Security](security.md).
